## Baseline (Manual Process)

Steps required each month in Excel:
1. Import & clean two CSVs (transactions + customers) — ~10 minutes  
2. Build 3 pivot tables (Revenue by Month, Top Products, Segment/Channel) — ~20 minutes  
3. Build & format 3 charts — ~15 minutes  
4. Create KPI cells (Revenue, Orders, Customers, AOV, Repeat Rate) — ~10 minutes  
5. Save outputs & prepare a short summary — ~5 minutes  

**Total manual time: ~60 minutes**

This reflects the **expected speed of a skilled analyst**. It is fast but realistic, accounting for essential tasks like formatting, QA, and presentation.
